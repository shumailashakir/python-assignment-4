# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:


def main():
    
    num1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
    num1 = int(num1)

    num2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
    num2 = int(num2)

    total_sum = num1 + num2

    print(f"The sum of the two numbers is: {total_sum}")

# 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
