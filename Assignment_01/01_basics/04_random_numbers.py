# Print 10 random numbers in the range 1 to 100.

# Here is an example run:

# 45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12

# Each time you run your program you should get different numbers

# 81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92

# Recall that the python random library has a function randint which returns an integer in the range set by the parameters (inclusive). For example this call would produce a random integer between 1 and 6, which could include 1 and could include 6:

# value = random.randint(1, 6)

import random

N_NUMBERS: int = 10
MIN_VALUE: int = 1
MAX_VALUE: int = 100

def main():

    for _ in range(N_NUMBERS):

        print(random.randint(MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE), end= " ")

    print()    


if __name__ == "__main__":

# import random

# N_NUMBERS: int = 10  # 10 numbers generate karne hain
# MIN_VALUE: int = 1    # Minimum value 1
# MAX_VALUE: int = 100  # Maximum value 100

# def main():
#     # 10 random numbers generate karna aur ek line me print karna
#     for _ in range(N_NUMBERS):
